Basically I agree with this, I'd just call the next release 0.2.0 (this 
indicates also that it's now a Gnome 2 application ;).

This versioning scheme will also indicate that we'll be assumed to use a 
split development model with stable and development branches, similar to 
the kernel development (however, the first kernel was 0.01, not 0.0.1).


Suggestion for the docs (and for us as a reminder):

_<some_section>_
Conglomerate Version Numbering.

Conglomerate uses a numbering scheme similar to the Linux kernel version 
numbering; odd numbers refer to an development or testing release and 
any even minor number version number refers to a stable version.

	<major level> . <minor level> . <patch level>

<major level>:

	Signifies major changes or rewrites.

<minor level>:

	Represents addeed or tweaked functionality
	on top of a largely coherent structure.

<patch level>:

	Refers to releases fixing bugs.
