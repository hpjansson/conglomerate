Conglomerate Version Numbering.

Conglomerate uses a numbering scheme similar to the Linux kernel version 
numbering; odd numbers refer to an development or testing release and 
any even minor number version number refers to a stable version.

	<major level> . <minor level> . <patch level>

<major level>:

	Signifies major changes or rewrites.

<minor level>:

	Represents addeed or tweaked functionality
	on top of a largely coherent structure.

	Even numbers are considered stable versions.

	Odd numbers are development versions fresh from the CVS repository


<patch level>:

	Refers to releases fixing bugs.
	These have odds and evens without any meaning.
	Usually there is an increment of one.
	However, development versions can have random increments.
	It is even possible to have different development versions
	with the same number.
