No worries Dave, I will make it work. FYI SRS = Software Requirement
Specification.

A useful doc, the SRS specifies requirements for the software in general
(usually determined by a customer). SRS assumes you have a SAD (Software
Architecture Document) and SDD (Software Design Document). Specifications in
the SRS are normally derived from the SAD and SDD.

A SRS may detail what features and functions will be included in the
application for this version. This helps in the following ways:
1. Dev knows how much work has to be done to comply with customer
requirements for this version.
2. Dev Managers know how much work is left to do at any stage in the dev.
3. Test Managers know what features will be included in releases.
4. Documentation knows what features and functions need to be tested and so
can prepare relevant procedures in the STP (Software Test Procedure),
incrementing the document to sync with the new version.
5. Documentation also knows that it can include these features and functions
in the User Manuals etc.
6. In the future, the SRS also enables dev to differential between bugs and
enhancements. Without the SRS you cannot have any bugs. This is because a
bug is essentially a feature or function that does not perform according to
the requirement specification. So if there is no SRS, you will not have
bugs.

From here you can see that the SRS will build a platform for future dev. It
will also enable managers to categorize future work into bugs fix, new
features (must have, nice to have), suggested enhancements.

Later,
