Version 0.7.2 announced september 18th 2003

Enhancements
Beginnings of RELAX NG support
      * An importer that reads DTD files and generate RELAX NG schema.
        (me)
      * A Conglomerate display specification for editing RELAX NG schema
        files. (me)
 
Beginnings of XHTML support:
      * A Conglomerate display specification for editing XHTML (strict)
        web pages. (me)
      * A simple template for creating new web pages. (me)
 
Attribute editing:
      * The Property dialog now has a tab page listing any attributes
        found in the DTD for the selected node (me)
      * Utility functions to make it easy to create attribute editors by
        binding GTK and Glade widgets to XML attributes (me)
      * A custom property dialog for DocBook <orderedlist> tags as an
        example of the above. (me)
 
Improvements to document type infrastructure:
      * Support for template files that can be used in the File->New
        assistant (Jeff Martin)
      * A template for creating new Conglomerate display specification
        files (Jeff Martin)
      * XML doc types can specify a file extension. For example, RELAX
        NG schema files have a ".rng" extension, and HTML files have
        ".html" extension. (me)
      * The display spec file can specify a formal Public ID for the
        DTD, and the code will try to use this, even if the XML file
        doesn't explicitly specify the DTD. (me)
      * The File->Properties dialog allows you to remove DTD
        associations, and can guess at a DTD if one is not present. It
        has a button to add the association to the document header. (me)
      * The display specification file format now supports XML
        namespaces (me)
 
Improvements to the "Cleanup the XML Source" tool
      * The tool now understands the difference between structural and
        span tags and doesn't force line breaks for span tags. (me)
      * Fixed some bugs and improved look of the resulting source, IMHO.
        (me)
 
Other Enhancements
      * Stability enhancements (me)
      * Improvements to the DTD for our display specification files (me,
        Jeff Martin)
      * Various test files should now be in the examples subdirectory of
        the tarball (Geert Stappers)
      * You can now merge adjacent paragraphs (as requested by Linux
        Weekly News) - move the cursor to the end of a <para> tag and
        press Delete, or to the start of a tag and press Backspace. (me)
      * Probably some other things I missed :-)
 
Fixes
      * Fixed lots of cleanup bugs when documents were closed; this
        makes the app much more stable. (me)
      * Fix for bux #118769 - a new dialog to select importers if more
        than one is applicable (me)
      * Empty context submenus are now insensitive (me)
      * Removed an unnecessary dependency on GDK 2.2 which broke the
        build on Red Hat 8
 
Thanks to
      * Jeff Martin
      * Geert Stappers
..and anyone else I missed (sorry!)

Version 0.7.1 announce september 2nd 2003
Enhancements
============
(i) German Translation (Christian Neumair)
(ii) Completely rewritten Text->DocBook importer; it now attempts to:
- spot lines that have been wrapped manually in the source document,
  and merges them back into lines.
- figure out where the actual paragraphs are and
  put them in para tags accordingly
- spot headings (either due to block capitals, or underlining),
  and create sect1 and title tags
- spot bullet points, and creates itemizedlist and listitem tags
  (very primitive at the moment).
                                                                                
It works quite well for our TODO document,
and most other documents I've been playing with.

Fixes
=====
- Fixed bug #115993 (Copy/Paste Not working at end of line) (me)
- Added some bulletproofing to the get next/prev word routines (me)
- Fixed various warnings and prototype problems (Pav Lucistnik, me)
