Conglomerate 0.7.10 Released
============================

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

This is still an unstable release; there are still some known repeatable
crash bugs. Please download it and test that no new bugs have been
introduced!

You can download it from the usual place:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82766


Enhancements
      * The Home and End keys now take you to the start/end of text
        within the current structural element; with Ctrl pressed they
        take you to the start/end of text within the document. Shift can
        be used to drag out selections as usual. This fixes bug #109698
        (me)


Fixes
      * Big rewrite of File->Properties dialog - it now uses Glade, it
        updates in response to changes of DTD, file URL and modification
        status (bugs #122029, 130728) (me)

      * Overview tree's root element now changes when the file's URL
        changes (bug #130728) (me)

      * Fix for bug #130724 (crash on loading examples/test-docbook.c)
        (me)

      * Added a wrapper function to generate generic property dialog
        descriptions to reduce translator workload (fixes bug #124780)
        (me)

      * Various documentation and Debian packaging fixes, including bug
        #123131 (Geert Stappers)

      * Disabled plugin support for Norman Walsh's website format as
        it's currently too broken to be worth supporting (see Bugzilla
        #113001 for some of the problems) (me)

Conglomerate 0.7.9 - "We Do The Work - You Do The Pleasure" Released

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type. In
keeping with recent trends in the GNOME project, the codename of this
release is a quotation from a movie. But can you tell which movie?

There are two features of this release. The first is a big rewrite of
the clipboard. You can now use the middle-mouse button to paste the
selection from Conglomerate into other X applications, and vice versa,
and various other clipboard bugs have been fixed. The other feature is
that I've gone through Bugzilla fixing as many bugs as possible. Please
download it and test that no new bugs have been introduced!
Unfortunately this is still an unstable release; there are still some
known repeatable crash bugs.

You can download it from the usual place:

Fixes
      * Fixed various compilation warnings (me) 

      * Fix for bug #125918 (Elements appearing in incorrect order) (me)

      * Fixed various bugs in the calculation of selection highlighting
        (including bug #124130); added an early reject to throw away
        unnecessary updates when dragging out a selection with the mouse
        (me)

      * Added ordering function for comparing nodes; fixed long-standing
        bug in CongRange reordering function which was causing glitches
        in the selection code (me)

      * Fixed bug when moving cursor to next word near end of a node's
        content which would generate an invalid cursor location
        off-by-one beyond the valid range (me)

      * Fix for bug #124508 (crash on inserting sibling) (me)

      * Fix for bug #125720 (crash on deleting nothing) (me)

        return if whitespace is being preserved) (me)

      * Fix for bug #129776 (missing @PKGDATADIR@ definition) (me and
        Geert Stappers)

Conglomerate version 0.7.8 - codenamed "What You See Is Hopefully What
You Saw Before" has been released.

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

Since the last release, the main thing that's happened is a big
reorganisation of the innards of the main editor widget. This has
simplified the code significantly, and puts us in a good position to fix
the bugs and speed things up. So hopefully this version will appear to
be identical to end-users. Please download it and test that no new bugs
have been introduced!

You can download it from the usual place:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82766


Enhancements
      * Big reorganisation of the implementation of the editor widget,
        simplifying the code (me)

      * New GObject class representing an XPath expression, which will
        help towards some future bugfixes (me)


Fixes
      * Fixed C99ism build problem on gcc-2.95.4 (Pav Lucistnik)

      * Fixed missing files in POTFILES.in (Marcel Telka, Geert
        Stappers)

      * Fixed lots of warnings (me)

      * Increased self-tests on cursor validity (me)

Conglomerate 0.7.7 - "Who Frobnicates the Frobnicators?" Released

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

Numerous bugs have been fixed in this release, together with some visual
improvements. However, Conglomerate is still UNSTABLE, and not yet ready
for heavy-duty production use. I used it to write these release notes in
DocBook without having to resort to Emacs, and had a single crash during
a half-hour editing period. Notable remaining problems are lack of
speed, inability to deal with external entities, and crashes when
nesting certain elements inside certain other elements.

Please test the new code as we work towards stabilising things towards a
0.8.0 release. You can download it frmo the usual place:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82766


Enhancements

        the xml:lang attribute and intltool; numerous other improvements
        (Me)
        
      * Ignore unnecessary whitespace text nodes in main editor view -
        Fix for bug #123367 by Anders Petersson giving a big visual
        enhancement ; fixed cursor movement to skip over them (me)
        
      * Updated translations - ca (Jordi Mallach), de (Christian
        Neumair), es (Francisco Javier F. Serrador), nl (Jeroen van der
        Vegt), pt (Duarte Loreto)
        

Fixes
      * Fix for bug 123065 (open using empty window instead of whole new
        window) (Robert Varga)
        
      * Portability improvements (Duraid Madina, Pav Lucistnik)
        
      * Get strings from immodule as UTF8, notify immodule of focus
        in/out (bug 125993) (Yukihiro Nakai)
        
      * Fixed unref of NULL uri (bug #126231) (Paul Smith)

Conglomerate 0.7.6 - "It Looks Like You're Writing A <letter>"
Released
 
   Conglomerate  is  a  free,  user-friendly  XML  editor.  It is
   particularly  aimed  at  DocBook, but should be able to handle
   any XML document type.
 
   Conglomerate   is  still  UNSTABLE,  and  not  yet  ready  for
   heavy-duty production use. Having said that I used it to write
   these  release  notes  in  DocBook without having to resort to
   Emacs,  and  it's  less painful than it was. Has crashed twice
   (so  far).  Notable  remaining  problems  are  lack  of speed,
   inability  to  deal  with  external entities, and crashes when
   nesting certain elements inside certain other elements.
 
   A  fair  amount  has changed since the last release: there are
   plenty  of  new  features  which  need testing. In particular,
   support for non-Roman scripts should be substantially better -
   we now support GTK Input Methods, and I believe I've fixed the
   last remaining multibyte character bug. Testers welcome!
 
Enhancements
 
     * Structural   headers   now  have  an  animated  disclosure
       triangle for folding the content (me)
     * Extension  of  selection  so  that  entire  nodes  can  be
       selected  as  well  as  ranges  of  text - try clicking on
       things! (me)
     * Bulletproofing various clipboard operations (me)
     * Editor  areas  now  support pre-lighting when the mouse is
       over  them;  there are various placeholder effects for now
       (me)
     * Editor  areas now support mouse cursors; text areas use an
       I-beam (me)
     * Support  for  template  documents which will appear in the
       Create New File assistant. (Jeff Martin)
     * Support for GTK Input Methods (me)
     * Now  uses  the  X CLIPBOARD for clipboard handling, rather
       than an internal buffer (me)
     * Span tags are now filtered using DTD if available (me)
     * If  there  is a gconf key specifying dispspec directories,
       load  them  from  there  instead  of  using  application's
       default directory. (Boris Goldowsky)
     * Enhancements  to  gtk-doc  documentation  coverage (Robert
       Varga)
     * Made moving the cursor to the right move through tags just
       like cursor movement to the left (bug #125341). (Geert-Jan
       Van den Bogaerde)
     * Removed last traces of GdkFont (me)
     * Change  the toolbar to give 'save' as an option instead of
       'save as' (David Hoover)
     * Fixes to help 64-bit architectures (me, Andreas Schwab)
     * Custom  display  of  DocBook  admonition  tags  <warning>,
       <caution> etc (code by me, artwork by Jakub Steiner)
     * Custom proprty dialog for DocBook <ulink> tags (me)
     * Simplified  usage  of  GnomeVFS; made it easy to switch to
       pure usage of libxml2's loaders (me)
     * Improvements to display specification for xds files (Boris
       Goldowsky)
     * Support for Apache Forrest documents (Boris Goldowsky)
     * New  translations:  az  (Metin  Amiroff), ca (Xavier Conde
       Rueda), el (Kostas Papadimas)
     * Updated  translations:  cs (Miloslav Trmac), de (Christian
       Neumair), sr, sr@Latn (Danilo Segan), sv (Christian Rose),
 
Fixes
 
     * Fixed  a  long-standing  byte  versus  char bug that broke
       cursor positioning in non-Roman scripts (me)
     * Self-test  now  handles  children  of  an entity reference
       correctly (me)
     * Fix for bug #125119 (me)
     * Fix  for  bug  #124011  -  now  handles  entity  reference
       children correctly within editor widget (me)
     * Fix  for  bug  #122365  -  List  item labels now update as
       appropriate (me)
     * Fix for bug #121984 (Boris Goldowsky)
     * Fixed various warnings; removed dead code (me)
     * Packaging fixes (Geert Stappers, Robert Varga)

Conglomerate 0.7.5 - "Now You See It, Now You Don't" Released

Conglomerate is becoming more usable, and is regularly used by the
author for small documents, including these release notes. However it is
still UNSTABLE, and not yet ready for heavy-duty production use.

In keeping with Gnome tradition, this release of Conglomerate is
codenamed with a phrase that makes no sense to most people reading the
release announcement. Enjoy :-)


Enhancements
      * Undo/Redo now works, with an unlimited history. Large amounts of
        the program was rewritten to allow this. (me)

      * Allow clicking beyond the end of the fragment of text, to make
        it easy to select past the end of a line (bug #121066) (me)

      * Improvements to the "Required Child" dialog to use Glade and be
        more HIG-compliant (David Hoover)

      * Parser error dialog now supports syntax highlighting if
        GtkSourceView is available (Geert-Jan Van den Bogaerde)

      * Display Specifications can now specify if whitespace is
        significant within an XML element. It is respected by the
        Cleanup XML Source tool, and there is some support in the main
        editor view. DocBook's <programlisting> tag is flagged to work
        this way. (me)

      * We now generate API documentation, using gtk-doc (Robert Varga,
        Geert Stappers, me)

      * New translation: cs - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)

      * Updated translations: de (Christian Neumair), sv (Christian
        Rose), pl (Artur Flinta), sr, sr@Latn (Danilo Segan), nl (Elros
        Cryiatan)


Fixes
      * Allow going one character beyond the end of text buffers, to
        allow for sane cursor movement (bug #121066 again) (me)

      * Stopped unnecessary addition of whitespace nodes when adding new
        structural elements (me)

Conglomerate 0.7.4, announced september 24th 2003

Conglomerate is currently UNSTABLE, and not suitable for production use.
Having said that, I used it to write these release notes: the dog-food
is getting tastier!

Enhancements
      * Source View now has syntax highlighting, provided you have
        GtkSourceView installed. It is optional. (Geert-Jan Van den
        Bogaerde)
      * Keyboard shortcut for "View Source" - Ctrl-U, the same as
        Mozilla (Geert-Jan Van den Bogaerde)
      * Entity declarations and entity references now appear in the
        document with black borders, similar to structural tags (me)
      * Cursor is now much more visible - we made it black! (Raphael
        Jacquot)
      * Cursor->left can now go through structural tags (Raphael Jacquot
        and me - stay tuned for the wonderful world of cursor->right)
      * Portugese translation (Duarte Loreto)
      * README is now generated from DocBook README.xml (Geert Stappers)

Fixes
      * Fix for bug 122967 and its many dups (assertion failure loading
        examples/file-roller.xml) (me)

Thanks to
      * Duarte Loreto

Conglomerate 0.7.3, announced september 23th 2003
  
 - Optimisations:  cursor movement and mouse dragging are now
 significantly faster for large documents, other operations should be
 slightly less chuggy than before.  (me)

Version 0.7.2 announced september 18th 2003

Enhancements
Beginnings of RELAX NG support
      * An importer that reads DTD files and generate RELAX NG schema.
        (me)
      * A Conglomerate display specification for editing RELAX NG schema
        files. (me)
 
Beginnings of XHTML support:
      * A Conglomerate display specification for editing XHTML (strict)
        web pages. (me)
      * A simple template for creating new web pages. (me)
 
Attribute editing:
      * The Property dialog now has a tab page listing any attributes
        found in the DTD for the selected node (me)
      * Utility functions to make it easy to create attribute editors by
        binding GTK and Glade widgets to XML attributes (me)
      * A custom property dialog for DocBook <orderedlist> tags as an
        example of the above. (me)
 
Improvements to document type infrastructure:
      * Support for template files that can be used in the File->New
        assistant (Jeff Martin)
      * A template for creating new Conglomerate display specification
        files (Jeff Martin)
      * XML doc types can specify a file extension. For example, RELAX
        NG schema files have a ".rng" extension, and HTML files have
        ".html" extension. (me)
      * The display spec file can specify a formal Public ID for the
        DTD, and the code will try to use this, even if the XML file
        doesn't explicitly specify the DTD. (me)
      * The File->Properties dialog allows you to remove DTD
        associations, and can guess at a DTD if one is not present. It
        has a button to add the association to the document header. (me)
      * The display specification file format now supports XML
        namespaces (me)
 
Improvements to the "Cleanup the XML Source" tool
      * The tool now understands the difference between structural and
        span tags and doesn't force line breaks for span tags. (me)
      * Fixed some bugs and improved look of the resulting source, IMHO.
        (me)
 
Other Enhancements
      * Stability enhancements (me)
      * Improvements to the DTD for our display specification files (me,
        Jeff Martin)
      * Various test files should now be in the examples subdirectory of
        the tarball (Geert Stappers)
      * You can now merge adjacent paragraphs (as requested by Linux
        Weekly News) - move the cursor to the end of a <para> tag and
        press Delete, or to the start of a tag and press Backspace. (me)
      * Probably some other things I missed :-)
 
Fixes
      * Fixed lots of cleanup bugs when documents were closed; this
        makes the app much more stable. (me)
      * Fix for bux #118769 - a new dialog to select importers if more
        than one is applicable (me)
      * Empty context submenus are now insensitive (me)
      * Removed an unnecessary dependency on GDK 2.2 which broke the
        build on Red Hat 8

      * Jeff Martin
      * Geert Stappers

Thanks to 
Sean Middleditch for suggestion to generate conglomerate.spec 


-----------------------------------------
Version 0.7.1 announce september 2nd 2003
Enhancements
============
(i) German Translation (Christian Neumair)
(ii) Completely rewritten Text->DocBook importer; it now attempts to:
- spot lines that have been wrapped manually in the source document,
  and merges them back into lines.
- figure out where the actual paragraphs are and
  put them in para tags accordingly
- spot headings (either due to block capitals, or underlining),
  and create sect1 and title tags
- spot bullet points, and creates itemizedlist and listitem tags
  (very primitive at the moment).
                                                                                
It works quite well for our TODO document,
and most other documents I've been playing with.

Fixes
=====
- Fixed bug #115993 (Copy/Paste Not working at end of line) (me)
- Added some bulletproofing to the get next/prev word routines (me)
- Fixed various warnings and prototype problems (Pav Lucistnik, me)

Dave Malcolm

-----------------------------------

- Dutch translation (Mark Van den Borre)
- Improvements to core architecture (me)
        - Most important structs are now GObjects
        - MVC framework now uses GObjects signals
        - MVC framework allows updates to be amortized, allowed a big optimisation of the "View Source" feature.
- Complete rewrite of the main editor control: (me)
