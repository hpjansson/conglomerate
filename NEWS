Conglomerate 0.7.14 Released
============================

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

This is still an unstable release; there are still some known repeatable
crash bugs. Please download it and test that no new bugs have been
introduced! 

Conglomerate now requires GTK+ version 2.4.0 or later

You can download it from the usual place:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82766

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release; my apologies if
I missed anyone from the credits below.


Updated Translations: 
      * Czech (cs) (Miloslav Trmac)
      * British English (en_GB) (Gareth Owen)

Enhancements
      * The Tools->Validate feature can now show you the errors when
        validation fails (Nickolay V. Shmyrev)
      * You can now select a DTD for documents lacking one, accessible
        via buttons in the File->Properties dialog and in the
        Tools->Validate error dialog (Dave Malcolm)
      * A new option in the File->New assistant for creating empty XML
        documents of arbitrary type. The assistant has a page which lets
        you enter the name of the top-level element, and its namespace
        URI (if any), with a little XML source preview that updates as
        you type. (Dave Malcolm)
      * Improvements to the internals of attribute editing, making code
        cleaner and fixing various crashes (Nickolay V. Shmyrev)
      * Rewrite of the File->Import UI, making use of GtkFileFilter (see
        bug # 144713 ). Hopefully the features are now a lot more
        "discoverable" than before. (Dave Malcolm)

Fixes
      * Fix layout of alert widget contents. (Nickolay V. Shmyrev)
      * Added the envar DocBook element ( bug # 144739 ) (Lars Trieloff)

Thanks
      * Miloslav Trmac
      * Gareth Owen

Conglomerate 0.7.13 Released
============================

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

This is still an unstable release; there are still some known repeatable
crash bugs. Please download it and test that no new bugs have been
introduced! 

Conglomerate now requires GTK+ version 2.4.0 or later. We use the new
file chooser dialog by default, and hope to make use of the other good
stuff as we work towards the 0.8 release.

You can download it from the usual place:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82766

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release; my apologies if
I missed anyone from the credits below.

Enhancements
      * Conglomerate no longer requires a display specification for an
        XML file. If the document type isn't recognised when loading a
        document, it switches to an alternate tree-based UI. (Dave
        Malcolm)
      * Implementation of Find and Replace, adapted from GEdit (Nickolay
        V. Shmyrev)
      * Added a Convert to Comment/Convert from Comment feature to the
        popup context menu (Dave Malcolm)
      * Added the beginnings of a plugin to view the document with a CSS
        stylesheet, using Dodji Seketeli's Sewfox library (Dave Malcolm)
      * Use GtkFileChooser rather than GtkFileSelector; we now require
        GTK 2.4 in configure.in (Dave Malcolm)
      * Big improvements to namespace handling code, including adding
        namespace support to attribute editing (Johannes Hölzl)
      * Properties dialog for DocBook elements now has a language
        selection widget (Nickolay V. Shmyrev)
      * Added the beginnings of a preferences dialog (Dave Malcolm)
      * Added a display specification for the OPML outliner format
        (Daniel Larsson)
      * Added support for a "Release Notes" document type, which I used
        to create these release notes (Jeff Martin)
      * Changes to LOTS of files, adding gtk-doc style comments to most
        functions. ( bug # 123318 ) Lots are currently placeholder
        comments, and will be filled in later. (David Hoover)
      * Added stubbed plugins for AbiWord, HTML and TEI support. Began
        work on a "View RELAX NG in compact form" plugin. (Dave Malcolm)
      * Finished implementating the "node tools" category of plugin;
        they now appear in the context menus and work; some simple
        examples implemented. (Dave Malcolm)
      * Added item to debug menu to dump plugin information into an XML
        file (Dave Malcolm)
      * Various packaging improvements (Geert Stappers)
      * Big rewrite of DTD->RELAX NG importer: now has a struct to
        handle options; inlines elements where it can to give a Russian
        Doll-style schema; adds a <start> element (Dave Malcolm)
      * Added a Properties dialog for the first span element (if any)
        when right-clicking in text areas. (Dave Malcolm)
      * Improvements to internal API support for DTDs, with new utility
        functions (finding cross-referencing of elements within DTD
        content models, guessing likely start elements, etc) (Dave
        Malcolm)
      * Building from CVS now requires the use of the flags: -Wall
        -Werror; various warnings fixed as a result of this (Dave
        Malcolm)
      * Cancelling the addition of required children elements now works
        properly, with enhancements to the internal API for modifying
        the document. See bug # 135865 for details. (Nickolay V.
        Shmyrev)
      * Added new menu item Help/Homepage that will open
        www.conglomerate.org in browser. (see bug # 134966 ). (Nickolay
        V. Shmyrev)

Fixes
      * Fixed a long-standing problem with the internal API
        (node_set_parent operation now has an explicit argument to
        indicate whether the node should be added at the end or
        beginning, fixing at least one subtle pointer manipulation bug
        (Dave Malcolm)
      * Big overhaul of path handling within the code (Toshio Kuratomi)
        and (Geert Stappers)
        , fixing bug # 135345 , bug # 121676
      * More cleanups of the internals of the popup menu code (Dave
        Malcolm)
      * Fix for bug # 143937 (Nickolay V. Shmyrev)

      * Autogenerate the marshalling code (Johannes Hölzl)
      * Removed unnecessary translation markings from debug menu strings
        (Dave Malcolm)
      * Updated the boilerplate example plugin code (Dave Malcolm)
      * Fixes for bug # 122813 ; eliminate markup inside translated
        strings (David Hoover)
      * Cleanup of internals of dispspec handling (Dave Malcolm)
      * Removed unnecessary test that stopped detecting nested
        cross-references to elements in a DTD, fixing bug # 136209 part
        (i) (Dave Malcolm)
      * Fix for bug # 135867 (crash when selecting Edit Display Spec)
        (Dave Malcolm)
      * Added tests to determine if we have a way of printing a
        document; set up the sensitivity of printing menu options
        appropriately (Dave Malcolm)
      * Add new parameters to function
        cong_error_dialog_with_convenience, fixing bug # 134950
        (Nickolay V. Shmyrev)
      * Applied patch by (hondaguru AT earthlink.net)
        for bug # 132884
      * Ensured the File->New assistant is fully constructed before it
        is shown to avoid ugly visual resizing (Dave Malcolm)
