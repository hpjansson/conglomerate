Conglomerate 0.7.12 Released
============================

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

This is still an unstable release; there are still some known repeatable
crash bugs. Please download it and test that no new bugs have been
introduced!

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release; my apologies if
I missed anyone from the credits below.


Enhancements
      * New translations: Croatian (hr) (Robert Sedak), Japanese (ja)
        (Mitsuru Oka)

      * Updated translations: Albanian (sq) (Laurent Dhima), Serbian
        (sr.po, sr@Latn.po) (Danilo Šegan), nl (Daniel van Eeden), Czech
        (cs) (Miloslav Trmac), Greek (el) ( Kostas Papadimas), German
        (de) (Christian Neumair), Croatian (hr) (Robert Sedak)

      * Added preliminary support for the TEI Lite format (Roberto
        Rosselli Del Turco)

      * Big fix of XML namespace handling. Dispspecs now refer to
        elements using a namespace URI (if any) and the local name
        within that namespace. Element-matching code now uses namespaces
        rather than prefixes in various places, including the XSL-FO and
        RELAX NG plugins, which should lead to more robust handling of
        arbitrary documents. (me) 

      * When determining which dispspec to use, calculate coverage of
        the document elements and pick the best (above a certain
        threshold percentage) (me)

      * New dialog for selecting which child element to insert when a
        DTD requires such a choice. The new dialog lists both the XML
        names and the translated names with icons where available (me)

      * Added a workaround for bug #124507 which pops up a dialog
        explaining what the problem is and tells you which elements are
        causing it. The problem elements will not appear in the editor
        widget. The dialog repeats every time the document is editor,
        but this is better behaviour than a silent crash :-) (me)


Fixes
      * Reorganised source tree so that the xds files live in their own
        "dispspecs" subdirectory, rather than sharing the "examples"
        folder with the sample instance documents (Geert Stappers)

      * Tidying up of plugin management code to use Service IDs to
        identify instances and GType to identify classes (me)

      * Big warning fix, should now compile cleanly on "-Wall -Werror"
        (me)

      * Big cleanup of the insides of the popup context menu, replacing
        lots of obcure hackery with a more maintainable system. (me)

Conglomerate 0.7.11 Released
============================

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly
aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

This is still an unstable release; there are still some known repeatable
crash bugs. Please download it and test that no new bugs have been
introduced! 

You can download it from the usual place:

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release; my apologies if

Enhancements
      * New translations: no (Kjaartan Marass), fr (Alban Browaeys), sq
        (Laurent Dhima)
        
      * Updated translations: cs (Miloslav Trmac), es (Francisco Javier
        F. Serrador), nl (Daniel van Eeden), no (Kjartan Maraas), pt
        (Duarte Loreto), sr/sr@Latn (Danilo Šegan), 
        
      * The File->New assistant now has a "Random Document" plugin,
        which is both great fun, and good for testing. If you select
        this, you reach a page where you can select a document type from
        those available (based on the dispspec files loaded). You can
        also specify a "depth" which is used to give an idea of how deep
        the document's tree should be. If a DTD is available,
        Conglomerate will try to ensure that the document is valid
        against that DTD. It also generates random text, to really push
        the unicode support (it generates random strings using most of
        the full range of Unicode). (me) 
        
      * If a DTD if found, the DTD tab of the Properties dialog for a
        node now has a "content model" view, showing the valid child
        elements that are allowed by the DTD in a tree form. (me)
        
      * First attempt at a "Find" dialog; improving this and the
        "Replace" dialog would make great jobs for programmers wanting
        to get involved. (me)
        
      * Big rewrite of the plugin code with the aim of eventually moving
        over to libgnomeoffice's framework. Plugins contain services of
        various kinds; everything is now a GObject subclass. (me)
        
      * The "--enable-printing" configuration option no longer requires
        libfo; this is now enabled separately with a new
        "--enable-libfo" option (me)
        
      * Change template code to use a <cong:template> element (Jeff
        Martin)
        
      * Toolbar now has a "New Document" button (Daniel van Eeden)
        
      * Internal improvements to GUI button sensitivity logic (Paul
        Smith)

      * User manual extended (Sean Wheller)

      * Extended User manual source files into tarball (Jeff Martin)
        

Fixes
      * Fix bug #130820 (me)
        
      * Fixed crash when loading file without a dispspec with no
        extension in its filename (me)
        
      * Fixed a bug in the template code (Daniel Larson)
        
      * Fixes for C99ism build problems on gcc-2.95.4 (Geert Stappers)
        
      * Fixed whitespace issues in the README files (David Hoover)
        
      * Various build fixes, including disabling gtk-doc for now (Geert)
        
      * Added a couple of DocBook tags to the display specification
        (Daniel Larsson)
        
      * Added a template file for display specifications to the examples
        subfolder (Boris Goldowsky)
