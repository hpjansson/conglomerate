Conglomerate 0.9.0 Released - Widget Rewrite #4 - Now with Interestingly Different Bugs!
========================================================================================

Conglomerate is a free, user-friendly XML editor. It is particularly aimed at DocBook, but should be able to handle any XML document type.

This is the first 0.9 release - the main editing widget has been rewritten since the last release (0.7.16). Please download it and try to break things (and fix them - patches gratefully acepted!).

The new code fixes a long-standing problem where Conglomerate would crash when loading certain documents. This has now been fixed (we believe), so that Conglomerate should now be able to load and display any well-formed XML document. The design is simpler and should enable us to implement more sophisticated effects in the future (e.g. table editing).

Unfortunately, whilst it's better than it was at loading files, it's now less stable when it comes to editing them. There are quite a few bugs still present in the new implementation - for example, "span tags" are invisible if present in a document loaded off disk (freshly created span tags appear as expected). This and other bugs can be seen below a tracker bug ( bug # 143769 ); please file bugs with editing and attach them to this tracker bug.

Conglomerate requires GTK+ version 2.4.0 or later

You can download it from the usual place: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82766
