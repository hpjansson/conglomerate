Version 0.7.1 announce september 2nd 2003
Enhancements
============
(i) German Translation (Christian Neumair)
(ii) Completely rewritten Text->DocBook importer; it now attempts to:
- spot lines that have been wrapped manually in the source document,
  and merges them back into lines.
- figure out where the actual paragraphs are and
  put them in para tags accordingly
- spot headings (either due to block capitals, or underlining),
  and create sect1 and title tags
- spot bullet points, and creates itemizedlist and listitem tags
  (very primitive at the moment).
                                                                                
It works quite well for our TODO document,
and most other documents I've been playing with.

Fixes
=====
- Fixed bug #115993 (Copy/Paste Not working at end of line) (me)
- Added some bulletproofing to the get next/prev word routines (me)
- Fixed various warnings and prototype problems (Pav Lucistnik, me)
