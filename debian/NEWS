conglomerate (0.7.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool, a build depend, will be installed by gnome-common.
  However Conglomerate needs intltool (>= 0.28) which has the OrigTree.pm.
  Buildd log shows that they pull in intltool-debian in stead of intltool.
  So expect there could be needed a 0.7.8-2.

conglomerate (0.7.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * There is gtk-doc, but it will not go into the debian package.
 It would make the .deb too fat with that programmers information.
 Fetch the source.tar.gz when you are interrested in the API stuff.
