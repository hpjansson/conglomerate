Hello Conglomerate user on a Debian GNU computer,

You probably know about
 http://www.conglomerate.org
for more information on conglomerate.

For Debian related issues, I advice
 http://packages.qa.debian.org/conglomerate

Use
 http://bugs.debian.org/conglomerate
to see what is on the todo list for the package.

Some words about the dependencies:
 Conglomerate is a XML editor, not a DocBook-XML only editor,
 that is why it just suggests docbook-xml. Their is no need
 to force installing the docbook-xml package.


I need help on Debian bug #217443
 http://bugs.debian.org/217443
it is about a probably cripple installation.
You do help me when you report your milage, such as

  - Conglomerate did first not work
  - when I did  ....[your observation]....
  - then it works fine
