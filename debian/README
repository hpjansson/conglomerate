Hello Conglomerate user on a Debian GNU computer,

You probably know about
 http://www.conglomerate.org
for more information on conglomerate.

For Debian related issues, I advice
 http://packages.qa.debian.org/conglomerate

Some words about the dependencies:
 Conglomerate is a XML editor, not a DocBook-XML only editor,
 that is why it just suggests docbook-xml. Their is no need
 to force installing the docbook-xml package.
