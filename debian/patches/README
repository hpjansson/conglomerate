Patches that you apply on each packages release.
"dpatch" helps you with that

Name convention:

 XX_name.dpatch

compliant with dpatch



Creating the patch file:

  zcat /usr/share/doc/dpatch/examples/sample.00template.gz > debian/patches/XX_name.patch
  cp path/file.name path/file.name.tarball
  vi path/file.name
  diff -u path/file.name.tarball path/file.name >> debian/patches/XX_name.patch

or for new files:

  diff -Nu /dev/null path/file.name >> debian/patches/XX_name.patch


  vi debian/patches/XX_name.patch \
    s/-p1/-p0/
    /^EOF/d

Or use the dpatch tools



Then there are some usefull, none dpatch scripts:

release:
The actions done when there is tarball release,
run it as `debian/patches/release 4.3.2-1`.

sync:
Get the release changes back into upstream version.

next:
Increment of the Debian changelog with the right string.
