Where ddd are three digits. 'P' is mandority prefix.



Creating the patch file:

  cp path/file.name path/file.name.tarball
  vi path/file.name
  diff -u path/file.name.tarball path/file.name > debian/patches/Pdddpath-file.name

or for new files:

  diff -Nu /dev/null path/file.name > debian/patches/Pdddpath-file.name
