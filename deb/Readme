Build information  18 october 2002


Here's what to do to make conge compile:
 1. install missing "sarge" packages:
        apt-get update
        apt-get install autoconf automake libtool libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-dev
 2. change "testing" to "unstable in /etc/apt/sources.list
 3. download packages needed from unstable/SID:
        apt-get update
        apt-get install libbonoboui2-dev libgnomeui-dev
 4. change "unstable" back to "testing" in /etc/apt/sources.list, and do
    the following command to avoid installing more from unstable/SID:
        apt-get update
 5. download and compile v. 0.2.8 of the flux library:
        cd ~/src/
        wget ftp://ftp.styx.net/projects/flux/libflux-0.2.8.tar.gz
        tar xzf libflux-0.2.8.tar.gz
        cd libflux-0.2.8/
        ./configure --prefix=/home/myuser/apps
        make
        make install
        cd ~/apps/lib/
        ln -s ./libflux.a libflux-old.a
 6. do a CVS checkout, autoconf, configure and build of conge:
        cd ~/src/
        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.copyleft.no:/cvs login
	# just hit enter, the anonymouse user has no password
        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.copyleft.no:/cvs co conge
	# now you have an other copy of _this_ file
        cd conge/
        ./autoconf.sh
        ./configure --prefix=/home/myuser/apps --with-flux-prefix=/home/myuser/apps
        make

Note that step 3 caused 15 other packages to be updated to the
versions in "unstable", 38 new packages to be installed, and another
26MB being used on my system.

These may not be changes that others wish to inflict on their systems.
