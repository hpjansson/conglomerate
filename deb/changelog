conglomerate (0.5.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release :
    - The executable is now named "conglomerate", rather than "conge"
    - Major rewrite of the node "Properties" dialog. It's now modeless,
      a lot tidier, and supports the renaming of attributes.
    - The display spec can now specify that Conglomerate should override
      the standard node property dialog for a tag, and use one from a plugin
      instead. I've begun the implementation of one of these plugins: a dialog
      that handles the standard attributes that are present on nearly every
      DocBook tag.
    - We no longer depend on eel or libbonoboui, which should make it easier
      to build
    - We now depend on libglade, which should make it much easier to support
      things like accessibility.
    - Numerous minor fixes
