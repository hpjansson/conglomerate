About
-----

This is a pre-release of an editor, Conge, to show the Conglomerate design
philosophy. It is based on structural document markup with XML. A totally
rewritten version is coming up in late january. To avoid confusion with this
release, the new one will probably be called "Congle".


Compiling
---------

Conge compilation should be quite simple, if you're lucky. There are no
autoconf or automake scripts, only a basic makefile. On most modern Unices,
this means you can type

make

and see what happens. This should produce an executable called "conge" in
your current directory.


Running
-------

Conge needs two files to be able to run and display something. The first is
an XML file (if it uses a DTD, this should be locatable as referred from the
XML file - there will be no validation done, and DTD-less documents are fine).
The second is a "displayspec", illustrated by "readme.ds" in the examples
directory. This specifies how the tags are rendered.

There are two ways to load a document into Conge. One is by specifying the
XML and displayspec files on the commandline, like this:

conge readme.xml readme.ds

The other is by using the GUI open dialogs. The readme example used above is
located in the examples directory, from the package root.


Contact
-------

All code herein is written by Hans Petter Jansson (hpj@styx.net), but please
don't send angry mails to him about it. He knows the extent of its
brokenness, and he is working on a nicely-implemented version, reusing no
code whatsoever.
