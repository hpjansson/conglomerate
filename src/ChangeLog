	Added support for new "xds" format XML-based dispspec file
	
2002-08-19 David Malcolm

	* dispspec.c, global.h, xmledit.c, xmlview.c

	Renamed struct cong_dispspec to CongDispspec
	
        * dispspec.c, global.h, popup.c

	New internal implementation of the dispspec code
	
	* dispspec.c, global.h, main.c, open.c, popup.c

	Changes to dispspec API, making the TTREE internal representation private
	
2002-08-16  David Malcolm

	* cong-document.c

	New file.
	
	* Makefile, global.h, main.c, open.c, save.c, tree.c, xmledit.c

	Updated code to use cong_document struct where appropriate (as opposed to a raw TTREE)
	
	* cong-location.c, global.h, popup.c, select.c, xmledit.c, xmlview.c

	Moved struct selection members t0,t1,c0,c1 over to using struct cong_location.

	* Makefile

	Added cong-location.o to objects, and libxml-2.0 to packages.

	* cong-location.c

	New file.

	* cursor.c, dispspec.c, global.h, popup.c, position.c, select.c, tree.c, xmldata.c, xmledit.c, xmlview.c

	Moved struct curs members t and c to a new cong_location struct (I aim to do this wherever the code uses a node/offset pair); introduced a cong_dispspec struct to replace explicit usage of TTREE as a precursor to changing the representation of dispspecs; added emacs layout to top of files (copied from Nautilus) 

	* main.c

	Added some test code, and corresponding items to the application's menu bar.

	* open.c

	Tracking changes to dispspec representation

	Moved most of the global vars into cong_globals and cong_gui structs; added UNUSED_VAR macro to reduce warning count; ported from GtkTree to GtkTreeView widget; added arguments to various cursor and selection functions to make their target explicit; replaced usage of assert with g_assert.

	* file.c

	Fixed a const-correctness problem
