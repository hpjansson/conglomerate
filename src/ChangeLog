	* cong-location.c

	New file.

	* cursor.c, dispspec.c, global.h, popup.c, position.c, select.c, tree.c, xmldata.c, xmledit.c, xmlview.c

	Moved struct curs members t and c to a new cong_location struct (I aim to do this wherever the code uses a node/offset pair); introduced a cong_dispspec struct to replace explicit usage of TTREE as a precursor to changing the representation of dispspecs; added emacs layout to top of files (copied from Nautilus) 

	* main.c

	Added some test code, and corresponding items to the application's menu bar.

	* open.c

	Tracking changes to dispspec representation
