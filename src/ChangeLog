	Moved dispspec from the_globals into each document, fixing many (but not all) bugs when working with multiple documents of different types.
	
2002-08-26 David Malcolm

	* cong-dispspec-registry.c

	New file:  manages a registry of all known dispspecs so that the app can guess at dispspecs as documents are loaded
	
	* Makefile

	Added cong-dispspec-registry.c

	* cong-error-dialog.c, cong-error-file-open.c, cong-error-file-save.c, cong-error-tests.c

	Added "convenience buttons" to some dialogs

	* dispspec.c, global.h, main.c, open.c

	The app now has a registry of dispspecs and automatically chooses one when a document is opened.

	* popup.c, xmledit.c, xmlview.c

	Minor cleanups
	
2002-08-25 David Malcolm

	* cong-error-file-open.c

	New file: more error handling, based on GnomeVFS

	* dispspec.c

	Added parsing of xds files from memory buffers

	* global.h

	Added Bonobo control embedding test

	* dispspec.c (cong_dispspec_new_from_xml_file)

	* cong-document.c

	New file.
	
	* Makefile, global.h, main.c, open.c, save.c, tree.c, xmledit.c

	* cong-location.c, global.h, popup.c, select.c, xmledit.c, xmlview.c

	Moved struct curs members t and c to a new cong_location struct (I aim to do this wherever the code uses a node/offset pair); introduced a cong_dispspec struct to replace explicit usage of TTREE as a precursor to changing the representation of dispspecs; added emacs layout to top of files (copied from Nautilus) 

	* main.c
