Some notes:
* The file conglomerate-C.omf has a hardcode path
 grep /usr/local conglomerate-C.omf
     <identifier url="file:/usr/local/share/gnome/help/conglomerate/C/conglomerate.xml"/>
Probably need a  conglomerate-C.omf.in

* there is conglomerate-C.omf.out generated.
It is the same a conglomerate-C.omf. I think we don't need the .in file
