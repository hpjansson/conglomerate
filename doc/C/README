In this directory you find "scrollkeeper" and "omf" stuff.

It is also the (last?) resort for files like:
 - faq.xml, general documentation.
 - foo, description.
 - bar, the favorite hang out of foo.

The files
  conglomerate-refentry.xml manpage.make conglomerate.1
are Unix manual page related. The conglomerate.1 file would be enough,
but this is the age of XML.
