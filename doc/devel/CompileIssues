In this file information on known compile issues
and possible a workaround for it.

There are three sections, common issues, released tarbal compile issues
and CVS checkout compile issues


Common compile issues
---------------------

If you get 
  cong-primary-window.c: In function `cong_primary_window_make_gui':
  cong-primary-window.c:412: error: `gettext' undeclared (first use in this function)
Then install the 'gettext' package.

Tarbal compile issues
---------------------

So far there no reports on released tarballs

CVS Checkout compile issues
---------------------------

On some system there are problems on generating "./libtool"
with the original "./autogen.sh". One solution is to run
"libtoolize --automake". An other is one to run "autoreconf --install"


Improvement to this is document is appreciated,
especially because that the problems don't occure on all systems
