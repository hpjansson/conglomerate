In this file information on known compile issues
and possible a workaround for it.

There are three sections, common issues, released tarbal compile issues
and CVS checkout compile issues


Common compile issues
---------------------

A 2.95 version of GCC fails when building the source.
Use a more recent compiler.

Tarbal compile issues
---------------------

So far there no reports on released tarballs

CVS Checkout compile issues
---------------------------

On some system there are problems on generating "./libtool"
with the original "./autogen.sh". One solution is to run
"libtoolize --automake". An other is one to run "autoreconf --install"


Improvement to this is document is appreciated,
especially because that the problems don't occure on all systems
