This is the conge TODO file.

If you're going to work on one of these,
please email conglomerate-devel@lists.copyleft.no
to avoid duplication of work.

Some of the jobs are quie easy, other are hard,
and other are "blue sky" goals for the future.

CODING:
- either port to the current Flux API or remove Flux dependency
- implement a proper MVC separation, with fine-grained updates
- get autoheader dependency working,
 then break global.h into separate header files
- fix the violations of the GNOME coding style guidelines
- comment the internal interfaces in gtk-doc style
- adding i18n support
- port over to SDI-based GUI (for compliance with GNOME HIG)
- improving the parser error report dialog
 (add highlighting and single-click selection)
- use standardised GNOME app menus, with correct stock icons
 (done using Bonobo so as to get menu merging?)
- make font choices a user prefererence?
 (using GConf and a preferences dialog)
- add a spellcheck feature
- add a grammar check feature
- add an irritating animated paperclip that says:
 "It looks like you're trying to write a structured document" :-)
- nicer GUI
 (various ideas have been posted to the list - logical groupings of tags)
- fix all the FIXMEs in the code
- get it working with SGML files
- get it so it can load the DocBook source code to the OReilly book
 "DocBook - the Definitive Guide"
 (currently fails due to problems with external entities and due to SGML issues)
- add support for comments within the XML
 (perhaps appearing as mini yellow sticky notes in the view)
- ability to edit attributes of tags somehow
 (right-click on the section header?)
- implement the external-reference component support in a less hackish way
- support drag-and-drop from file managers into the external component tags
- implement inline XML component support
- implement a table-editing component
- make Conglomerate a Bonobo control; get it working in Nautilus, Evolution etc
- some kind of template support (maybe a Create New File helper/druid)
- some kind of transformation view,
 showing results of a transformation of the file into HTML
 or printable form "live" as you edit

OTHER:
- improvements to existing xds files
- more xds files to cover other DTDs out there
- design icons for dispspec elements?  (we _might_ support this in future)
- get the website more up-to-date
- do translations when we have the i18n support,
 both for the program and for the xds files
- use Conglomerate and see what needs improving, find bugs etc

Any other ideas?
