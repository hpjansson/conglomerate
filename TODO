This is the conge TODO file.

If you're going to work on one of these,
please email conglomerate-devel@lists.copyleft.no
to avoid duplication of work.

Some of the jobs are quite easy, other are hard,
and other are "blue sky" goals for the future.

I've added some rough estimates of the complexity of each job.

CODING BEFORE RELEASE
- sort out font crash
- improve the configuration tests
- remove the preprocessor cruft (the old unused versions of code)
- update AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE in configure.in
- update README about the congle/conge name
- update README about running conge

OTHER JOBS BEFORE RELEASE
- get the website more up-to-date
- improve the look of the website
- write some documentation on the state of the code

CODING AFTER RELEASE
- implement a proper MVC separation, with fine-grained updates (Hard)
- get autoheader dependency working, 
 then break global.h into separate header files  (Easy)
- fix the violations of the GNOME coding style guidelines (Easy)
- comment the internal interfaces in gtk-doc style (Easy)
- adding i18n support (Medium)
- port over to SDI-based GUI (for compliance with GNOME HIG) (Medium)
- improving the parser error report dialog
 (add highlighting and single-click selection)  (Easy)
- use standardised GNOME app menus, with correct stock icons
 (done using Bonobo so as to get menu merging?) (Easy)
- make font choices a user prefererence?
 (using GConf and a preferences dialog)  (Medium)
- add a spellcheck feature (Hard)
- add a grammar check feature (Hard)
  (possibly look at AbiWord bug #3281, and
   http://www.gnu.org/software/diction/diction.html)
- add an irritating animated paperclip that says:
 "It looks like you're trying to write a structured document" :-)
- nicer GUI
 (various ideas have been posted to the list - logical groupings of tags)
- fix all the FIXMEs in the code
- get it working with SGML files (Medium; possibly requires upstream changes to
  libxml)
- get it so it can load the DocBook source code to the OReilly book
 "DocBook - the Definitive Guide"
 (currently fails due to problems with external entities and due to SGML issues)
- add support for comments within the XML
 (perhaps appearing as mini yellow sticky notes in the view) (Medium)
- ability to edit attributes of tags somehow
 (right-click on the section header?) (Medium)
- implement the external-reference component support in a less hackish way 
  (Medium)
- support drag-and-drop from file managers into the external component tags
  (Medium)
- implement inline XML component support (Hard)
- implement a table-editing component (Hard)
- make Conglomerate a Bonobo control; get it working in Nautilus, Evolution etc
  (Medium)
- some kind of template support (maybe a Create New File helper/druid) (Easy)
- some kind of transformation view,
 showing results of a transformation of the file into HTML
 or printable form "live" as you edit (Hard)
- perhaps a promote/demote facility for things like sect1 through to sect5 in 
 DocBook to make it easier to play around with structure?
- Undo/Redo support (Hard)
- rewrite xmlview.c/xmledit.c to avoid the GtkDrawingArea mess (Hard)
- Use Pango within xmledit.c (Hard?)
- Allow multi-charset input (using Pango?)
- audit the use of different char types (Medium)
- stronger use of DTD information (Hard)
- fix the paragraph support (Medium)
- write some kind of code overview (Easy)

OTHER JOBS AFTER RELEASE:
- improvements to existing xds files (Easy)
- more xds files to cover other DTDs out there (Easy)
- design icons for dispspec elements?  (we _might_ support this in future)
- do translations when we have the i18n support,
 both for the program and for the xds files  (Easy)
- use Conglomerate and see what needs improving, find BUGS etc
- write some documentation (Medium)

ANYTIME JOBS
- remove of Makefile in the directories examples, documentation and deb
- use the file AUTHORS to generate authors in the About box

Any other ideas?
 tell them to the developers mailinglist
