About
-----

This is a work-in-progress version of an editor, Conge, to show the 
Conglomerate design philosophy. It is based on structural document markup 
with XML. 

It was originally planned as a temporary prototype, with a totally rewritten 
version called "Congle" intended to replace it.  But due to a lack of time
the project languished for two years, until eventually the project was
restarted using the original "conge" codebase, attempting to clean it up into
a usable form.


Compiling
---------

Conglomerate is going to be a GNOME 2 application and we use various GNOME 
components.  Hence you'll need a reasonably up-to-date install of GNOME 2 to
build it.

If you're compiling from CVS, type

  ./autogen.sh

Next type

  make

and see what happens. This should produce an executable called "conge" in
the src/ current directory.

Currently you need to run conge from "src" directory for it to work.

In theory, compiling on Windows should be equally simple, if you're using Cygwin
(http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/). The process is basically the same as on Unix.
However, to my knowledge (Dave Malcolm 20th October 2002), no-one has attempted
to build a Windows version for a long time; please contact the development list
(see below) if you attempt this to let us know how you get on.


Running
-------

(Dave Malcolm 20 October 2002:  the text in this section is out of date; need to rewrite!!!)

Conge needs two files to be able to run and display something. The first is
an XML file (if it uses a DTD, this should be locatable as referred from the
XML file - there will be no validation done, and DTD-less documents are fine).
The second is a "displayspec", illustrated by "readme.xds" in the examples
directory. This specifies how the tags are rendered.

There are two ways to load a document into Conge. One is by specifying the
XML and displayspec files on the commandline, like this:

conge readme.xml readme.ds

The other is by using the GUI open dialogs. The readme example used above is
located in the examples directory, from the package root.

NOTE: It looks like the file requester is not working properly on Windows,
and I don't have the time to figure out why. The command line arguments
should work fine, though.


Using
-----

Very basic. Try marking some text and right-clicking. The selection field
will be yellow for legal tag insertion points, and red-ish wherever insertion
is disallowed to promote proper tag nesting.

You can also right-click items in the left-hand treeview and see what
happens.

Many of the menu options are currently unimplemented.

The code was originally written by Hans Petter Jansson (hpj@styx.net), but please
don't send angry mails to him about it. Most coding is currently being done by
Dave Malcolm (david@davemalcolm.demon.co.uk), but you should direct questions to
the development list (see above) for the moment.
