See the file README.xml; this is in the DocBook format and can be read using Conglomerate (assuming you have it installed), or another XML editor.

Otherwise, you can read it using a text editor (and try to ignore all the tags), or convert it into another format, such as HTML.  Try typing this:

	 docbook2html README.xml

This ought to generate an HTML version of the document that you should be able to read in a web browser.
