About
-----

This is a work-in-progress version of an editor, Conge, to show the 
Conglomerate design philosophy. It is based on structural document markup 
with XML. 

It was originally planned as a temporary prototype, with a totally rewritten 
version called "Congle" intended to replace it.  But due to a lack of time
the project languished for two years, until eventually the project was
restarted using the original "conge" codebase, attempting to clean it up into
a usable form.


Compiling
---------

Conglomerate uses various GNOME 2 components (though it should run fine under
both GNOME and KDE).  Hence you'll need a reasonably up-to-date install of GNOME 2
(and the developer packages) to build it.

  ./configure
  make
  (switch to superuser if necessary)
  make install

If you're compiling from CVS, type

  ./autogen.sh   	# which does generate and run ./configure
  make
  (switch to superuser if necessary)
  make install

and see what happens. This should produce an executable called "conge" in
the src/ current directory.  Typing "make install" installs the program and
its data files into a hopefully sensible location.

On some systems, example given Red Hat 8, you have to type

   libtoolize --automake
   ./configure
   make

   see also the file documentation/CompileIssues


In theory, compiling on Windows should be equally simple, if you're using Cygwin
(http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/). The process is basically the same as on Unix.
However, to my knowledge (Dave Malcolm 20th October 2002), no-one has attempted
to build a Windows version for a long time; please contact the development list
(see below) if you attempt this to let us know how you get on.


If you want to make a debian package from the tarbal or CVS type

   deb/build




Running
-------

Currently you need to install conge for it to work (so that it can find its data files)

Conge needs two files to be able to run and display something. The first is
an XML file (if it uses a DTD, this should be locatable as referred from the
XML file - there will be no validation done, and DTD-less documents are fine).
The second is a "displayspec", illustrated by "readme.xds" in the examples
directory. This specifies how the tags are rendered.

There are two ways to load a document into Conge. One is by specifying the
XML on the commandline, like this:

conge file:///home/david/readme.xml
(currently you have to use a GnomeVFS URI)

The other is by using the GUI open dialogs. The readme example used above is
located in the examples directory, from the package root.

Using
-----

Very basic. Try marking some text and right-clicking. The selection field
will be yellow for legal tag insertion points, and red-ish wherever insertion
is disallowed to promote proper tag nesting.

You can also right-click items in the left-hand treeview and see what
happens.

Many of the menu options are currently unimplemented.

The code was originally written by Hans Petter Jansson (hpj@styx.net), but please
don't send angry mails to him about it. Most coding is currently being done by
Dave Malcolm (david@davemalcolm.demon.co.uk), but you should direct questions to
the development list (see above) for the moment.
