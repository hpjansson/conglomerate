About Conglomerate

   This is a work-in-progress version of the Conglomerate editor.
   It is based on structural document markup with XML.

Compiling

   Conglomerate uses various GNOME 2 components (though it should
   run fine under both GNOME and KDE). Hence you'll need a
   reasonably up-to-date install of GNOME 2 (and the developer
   packages) to build it.
    1.
./configure
    2.
make
    3. Switch to superuser if necessary
    4.
make install

   If you're compiling from CVS, you will need the
   gnome-commonmodule from GNOME CVS installed. Then type
    1.
./autogen.sh
                        which generates and runs
                        ./configure
    2.
make
    3. Switch to superuser if necessary
    4.
make install

   and see what happens. This should produce an executable called
   conglomeratein the srcdirectory. Typing make installinstalls
   the program and its data files into a hopefully sensible
   location.

   On some systems, example given Red Hat 8, you have to type
    1.
libtoolize --automake
    2.
./configure
    3.
make

   see also the file doc/devel/CompileIssues

Debian

   If you want to make a debian package from the tarbal, type

   fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us

   and when you have a deb-src line in /etc/apt/sourcetype

   apt-get source -b conglomerate

Windows

   The original prototype of Conglomerate built and ran under
   Windows, probably using Cygwin
   (http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/). The process is basically the
   same as on Unix. Much has changed within the code since then -
   please let the development list know if you attempt to build
   it. There has been a recent attempt to get Conglomerate to
   build on Win32; see
   http://lists.copyleft.no/pipermail/conglomerate-devel/2003-Sep
   tember/001279.html.

Mac OS X

   We managed to build one of the Conglomerate 0.5 tarballs on
   Mac OS X using Fink at GUADEC 4 in Dublin. FIXME: add link to
   screenshot

Running

   Currently you need to install conglomeratefor it to work (so
   that it can find its data files)

   Conglomerate needs two files to be able to run and display
   something. The first is an XML file (if it uses a DTD, this
   should be locatable as referred from the XML file - there will
   be no validation done, and DTD-less documents are fine). The
   second is a "displayspec", illustrated by readme.xdsin the
   examplesdirectory. This specifies how the tags are rendered.

   There are two ways to load a document into Conglomerate. One
   is by specifying the XML on the commandline, like this:

   conglomerate readme.xml

   The other is by using the GUI open dialogs. The readme example
   used above is located in the examples directory, from the
   package root.

Using

   Try marking some text and right-clicking. The selection field
   will be inverted for legal tag insertion points, and red
   wherever insertion is disallowed to promote proper tag
   nesting.

   You can also right-click items in the left-hand treeview and
   see what happens.

   Many of the menu options are currently unimplemented.

   The latest updates are available through anonymous CVS from
   GNOME's CVS server:

   cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome
   checkout conglomerate

   CVS is also web-browsable:

   The code was originally written by Hans Petter Jansson
   (hpj@styx.net), but please don't send angry mails to him about
   it. Most coding is currently being done by Dave Malcolm
   (david@davemalcolm.demon.co.uk), but you should direct
   questions to the development list (see above) for the moment.
