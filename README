About Conglomerate

   This is a work-in-progress version of the Conglomerate editor. It is
   based on structural document markup with XML.

Compiling

   Conglomerate uses various GNOME 2 components (though it should run
   fine under both GNOME and KDE). Hence you'll need a reasonably
   up-to-date install of GNOME 2 (and the developer packages) to build
   it.
    1.
./configure
    2.
make
    3. Switch to superuser if necessary
    4.
make install

   If you're compiling from CVS, you will need the gnome-commonmodule
   from GNOME CVS installed. Then type
    1.
./autogen.sh
                        which generates and runs
                        ./configure
    2.
make
    3. Switch to superuser if necessary
    4.
make install

   and see what happens. This should produce an executable called
   conglomeratein the srcdirectory. Typing make installinstalls the
   program and its data files into a hopefully sensible location.

   On some systems, example given Red Hat 8, you have to type
    1.
libtoolize --automake
    2.
./configure
    3.
make

   see also the file doc/devel/CompileIssues

Debian

   If you want to make a debian package from the tarbal or CVS type

   deb/build

   and when you have a deb-src line in /etc/apt/sourcetype

   apt-get source -b conglomerate

Windows

   The original prototype of Conglomerate built and ran under Windows,
   probably using Cygwin ([17]http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/). The process
   is basically the same as on Unix. Much has changed within the code
   since then - please let the development list know if you attempt to
   build it. There has been a recent attempt to get Conglomerate to build
   on Win32; see [18]here.

Mac OS X

   We managed to build one of the Conglomerate 0.5 tarballs on Mac OS X
   using Fink at GUADEC 4 in Dublin. FIXME: add link to screenshot

Running

   Currently you need to install conglomeratefor it to work (so that it
   can find its data files)

   Conglomerate needs two files to be able to run and display something.
   The first is an XML file (if it uses a DTD, this should be locatable
   as referred from the XML file - there will be no validation done, and
   DTD-less documents are fine). The second is a "displayspec",
   illustrated by readme.xdsin the examplesdirectory. This specifies how
   the tags are rendered.

   There are two ways to load a document into Conglomerate. One is by
   specifying the XML on the commandline, like this:

   conglomerate readme.xml

   The other is by using the GUI open dialogs. The readme example used
   above is located in the examples directory, from the package root.

Using

   Try marking some text and right-clicking. The selection field will be
   inverted for legal tag insertion points, and red wherever insertion is
   disallowed to promote proper tag nesting.

   You can also right-click items in the left-hand treeview and see what
   happens.

   Many of the menu options are currently unimplemented.

   The latest updates are available through anonymous CVS from GNOME's
   CVS server:

   cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout
   conglomerate

   CVS is also web-browsable:

   The code was originally written by Hans Petter Jansson (hpj@styx.net),
   but please don't send angry mails to him about it. Most coding is
   currently being done by Dave Malcolm (david@davemalcolm.demon.co.uk),
   but you should direct questions to the development list (see above)
   for the moment.
