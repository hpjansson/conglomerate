About
-----

This is a pre-release of an editor, Conge, to show the Conglomerate design
philosophy. It is based on structural document markup with XML. A totally
rewritten version is coming up in late january. To avoid confusion with this
release, the new one will probably be called "Congle".

Compiling
---------

Conge compilation should be quite simple, if you're lucky. You will need
GTK/GDK 2.0.5 or later, as well as Flux 0.2.8, available from

ftp://ftp.styx.net/projects/flux/libflux-0.2.8.tar.gz

(20 september 2002: 0.2.8 is still the "current" flux for conge)
You should configure, make, and install this to your development prefix.  You
may then need to rename (prefix)/lib/libflux.a to (prefix)/lib/libflux-old.a
This is a temporary workaround to deal with the fact that libflux has been
under heavy development, whereas conge has been left untouched.

Type

  ./autogen.sh --with-flux-prefix=

If Flux is not in your default prefix, you should do

  ./autogen.sh --with-flux-prefix=/opt/flux-old

(Or wherever you installed it to. I installed it to /opt/flux-old to
keep it separated from the rest of my system). It will still link to
-lflux-old, so you want to do the rename trick, or change that to -lflux
in configure.in.

Next type

  make

and see what happens. This should produce an executable called "conge" in
your current directory.

Compiling on Windows should be equally simple, if you're using Cygwin
(http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/):

0) Make sure you have the Windows DLLs for GTK/GDK. Put them in the src/ dir.
1) Edit global.h, change #undef WINDOWS_BUILD to #define WINDOWS_BUILD 1
2) Copy "Makefile.win" to "Makefile".
3) make
          ***** Please confirm if it still compiles on Win32 *****

Running
-------

Conge needs two files to be able to run and display something. The first is
an XML file (if it uses a DTD, this should be locatable as referred from the
XML file - there will be no validation done, and DTD-less documents are fine).
The second is a "displayspec", illustrated by "readme.ds" in the examples
directory. This specifies how the tags are rendered.

There are two ways to load a document into Conge. One is by specifying the
XML and displayspec files on the commandline, like this:

conge readme.xml readme.ds

The other is by using the GUI open dialogs. The readme example used above is
located in the examples directory, from the package root.

NOTE: It looks like the file requester is not working properly on Windows,
and I don't have the time to figure out why. The command line arguments
should work fine, though.


Using
-----

Very basic. Try marking some text and right-clicking. The selection field
will be yellow for legal tag insertion points, and red-ish wherever insertion
is disallowed to promote proper tag nesting.

You can also right-click items in the left-hand treeview and see what
happens.

All code herein is written by Hans Petter Jansson (hpj@styx.net), but please
don't send angry mails to him about it. He knows the extent of its
brokenness, and he is working on a nicely-implemented version, reusing no
code whatsoever.
