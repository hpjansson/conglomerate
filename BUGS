The current editor control is highly unstable, and will be rewritten soon, so please don't report bugs with editing for now. 

For other bugs, we are using the Bug Tracking Database provided by the nice folk at the GNOME project.  Please have a look at the "conglomerate" component at http://bugzilla.gnome.org, and see if the bug you've found is already there.  If not, please add a bug report! 

In the past, we used this file to list known bugs.  Someone ought to go through this list and either move the bugs into Bugzilla or delete them:
- Save As does not change the name in the title bar
- Save As does not remove the (modified) designation behind the title
- Cut / Copy / Paste does not work with the X Clipboard
- Cannot type new text into document
- Cannot add new structural tags
- need better handling of unrecognised tags (those not in the dispspec).  Currently they simply don't appear.   Should they appear as structural elements???

# better ten known bugs, than one unknown
